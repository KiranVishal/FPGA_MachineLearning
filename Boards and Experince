Xilinx - ISE Design suit -> Vivado (for the newer boards)
Altera - Quartus -> Quatrus || Design suit

Used Xilinx ISE with verilog for a while.

Currently moving to Altera Boards with Quartus ||
The decision for this switch is simply beaucse of the availabilty of resources in the lab I work in.

We have a setup of four Stratix V boards in a cluster. And also a Cyclone V board. All boards are dirrectly connected using a PCIe
